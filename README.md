# Summary

As the U.S. government’s official web portals, USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov seek to have a comprehensive search across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. 

We have posted the URLs in two files:

* government-urls-alphabetic-list.txt -- a list of the domains with accompanying notes collected over time
* government-urls-hierarchical-list.txt -- a flat list of domains segmented by state abbreviations. I.e. usagovAK, usagovAL, etc.

Symbols that will you find in the hierarchical list include:

* UF (used for) is the reciprocal of the USE reference and accompanies the term to which the USE reference refers;
* BT (broader term) refers from a term for a member of a class to the term for the class;
* NT (narrower term) refers from a term for a class to the term for one of its members;
* RT (related term) is used between related terms when it seems helpful to bring associated types of evidence to the user's attention.

# Acknowledgements

Marilyn Kercher started this list a long time ago. She took it as her personal mission to ensure that people could find information in the USASearch engine that do not end in .gov. She would be thrilled to learn that her list is open for anyone to access.

We hope that this list helps shine a light on where government information lives, and we welcome comments and additions.

Thank you,

USASearch
